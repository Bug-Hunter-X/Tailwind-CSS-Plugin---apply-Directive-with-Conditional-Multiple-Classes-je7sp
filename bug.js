This bug is related to the usage of Tailwind's `@apply` directive within a plugin.  The issue arises when trying to apply multiple utility classes conditionally based on a prop, resulting in unexpected behavior or no styles being applied at all. For example:

```javascript
module.exports = function ({ addUtilities }) {
  addUtilities({
    '.my-conditional-class': {
      // This doesn't work reliably when multiple classes are conditionally applied
      '@apply': props => props.isActive ? 'text-blue-500 bg-gray-100' : 'text-gray-500'
    }
  })
}
```
